# Stencil

Stencil is a rich templating system for Java, heavily inspired by Django and Twig. 

It supports running in a servlet environment, on Android and will eventually support being compiled to GWT as well.

## Getting started

All of the required dependencies are shipped in the lib/ folder. To compile, type "ant" in the root folder.
